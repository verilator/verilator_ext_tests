[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/verilator/verilator_ext_tests.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/verilator/verilator_ext_tests)

# Purpose

This project contains additional tests for Verilator. These are generally
tests that run for a long time, and/or use source code from other projects.

To file issues, etc, please see https://verilator.org.

# Usage

Initial prep

```
git submodule update
```

Run an individual test:

```
export VERILATOR_ROOT=location  # if your shell is bash
setenv VERILATOR_ROOT location  # if your shell is csh
t/t_a_hello.pl
```

Automatically run these tests as part of normal Verilator "make test"

```
export VERILATOR_TESTS_SITE=$VERILATOR_TESTS_SITE:$PWD  # if your shell is bash
setenv VERILATOR_TESTS_SITE $VERILATOR_TESTS_SITE:$PWD  # if your shell is csh
```

Cleanup

```
make clean
```

# Adding additional tests

To add additional tests, add a `t/t_{name}.pl` file.  See the Verilator
internals documentation for instructions on the test file format.

To be accepted in this package, an external submodule tested here must:

* Be under an open source license.
* Be available as a git repository.
* Be self checking (potentially checked by the t/ script you write).
* Be Verilator lint clean (using lint_off pragmas in code is fine).
* Be willing to consider patches as needed (i.e. not a "dead project").
* Already run CI against a fixed version of Verilator
